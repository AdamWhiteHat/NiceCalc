# NiceCalc
An arbitrary precision desktop calculator with some limited scripting capability.

The goal for this project was to mimic the functionality of preccalc: [https://preccalc.sourceforge.net](https://preccalc.sourceforge.net)

And improve upon it by by removing the 1 sticking point that decreases efficienct and wastes time when you use the tool as much and as often as I do:
I removed the need for typing print statements all the time!

## Feature List:
- NiceCalc will automatically prints the evaluated results of each line.
- It also copies over all padding, indentation, alignment whitespace and empty lines to preserve spacing and alignment.
- String literals which can be used as labels or comments can be included by quoting the string literal using either single quotes or double quotes, which ever you prefer.
- Font size can be increased or decreased by holding down the CTRL key and scrolling the mouse wheel.
- CTRL + ENTER to evaluate instead of adding a new line is configurable by a checkbox on the toolbar.
- Features word completion suggestions
- Control of the numerical precision is accessable right on the toolbar, just like preccalc.
- Suppots givine answers as exact fractions (a/b) when possible, enabled via a checkbox on the toolbar, just like preccalc.
- ESC clears the input and output.
- Unlimited undo and redo, with the state saved and added onto the undo/redo stack upon every evaluation.
- Bound variables and their values are always visible.
